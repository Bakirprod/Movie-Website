<p>

This soap opera depicts the misadventures of two brothers confronted with the prison world. The plot revolves around the various prisons in which they themselves or some of their relatives will be imprisoned, as well as their successive escape attempts.<br>

Lincoln Burrows, a little mobster, is wrongly accused of killing the brother of the Vice President of the United States. Sentenced to death, he is being held in Fox River State Penitentiary, awaiting execution. His brother, Michael Scofield, a gifted engineer convinced of his innocence, will help him escape before the fateful date. For this, Michael has the prison plans tattooed on his chest, arms and back, then he commits a robbery in order to be imprisoned there in turn. Once imprisoned in Fox River, Michael will seek to escape in the company of his brother, using the plans which he had tattooed on the body.<br>

After their escape, Michael and Lincoln are wanted not only by the police, but also by agents of the Cartel, a secret organization behind the conspiracy that brought Lincoln to death row. Their run takes them to Panama, where Michael is arrested by local police and held in Sona Penitentiary, where inmates have been on their own since a riot broke out there. He was later held in Ogygia prison in Yemen as civil war raged in the surrounding area. In both cases, Lincoln, left outside, will help Michael to escape, with the support of several of their friends or allies of circumstance previously met in Fox River or during their run.<br>
